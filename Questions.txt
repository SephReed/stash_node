Stash Q&A with Chris:



0. Plug in: power/ethernet
1. turn on (always on)
2. pro downloads/update full blockchain; personal wallet, key, queries blockchain servers
3. get android wallet (before)
4. small screen shows QR, USB keys plug into phone and Node.  Pair


Node:
Solves server side problems, like a treasor for servers
When stolen, transfer off fast.
Watches and verifies all blockchain hashes.



Node Security:
Open to a few protocols.  Deposit, Witdrawl, Send




Stash App:
1. Can keep money on phone.
2. Treasor does signing.
	-piece of hardware which stores private key
3. Uses BIP47, 2 way reusable address but private
4. Just app, no node accounts, all on chain
5. Connect to friend node, not paired deposit check fast


Treasor Endorsing: none



BIP47 Security:
1. Anonymous on chain.
2. Solves address reuse
3. Comes with a return address.




Stash App Security:
1. phone get's lost reseed
2. phone get's hacked
	1. without node or treasor - bitcoin
	2. with node - OT access
3. ECC Ed25519, AES
4. End to End Encrypted messaging.




App vs Banking App:
Not yet as secure










OT Notary:
1. incluig cheques (fully analogous o paper cheques)
2. including untraceable digtal cash
3. recurring payment plans
 scriptable (customizable) smart contracts 16:36
 bid/ask markets 16:37
 (exchange) 16:37
 end-t-end encrypted messaging with decentralized identity credentials 16:37
 vouhers (cashier's cheques) 16:37
 basket curencies



OT vs Blockchain:
Average use case, move back to blockchain.


OT Security:



Ricardian Contract:
Contract with human readable terms



Personal Edition:
Not a full node, must trust other full nodes, does not have privacy, can't do color coins.
Does have all the OT stuff.  Still stores coin, but less anonymous.

Lookup: SPD


Entrepise Edition:
Support, Stash Pools, Scalable & Powerful

Stash Pool:
Prevents theft and fraud.  Multiple servers form a pool.  Only works for enterprise due to overhead.




uses Tor so no need for opening Ports

don't have to trust others, more privacy.


full can do colored coins.


enterprise can do stash pool.

has encrypted messaging
